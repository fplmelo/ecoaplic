      <description>Chalkboard With this plugin you can add a chalkboard to reveal.js. The plugin provides two possibilities to include handwritten notes to your presentation:
you can make notes directly on the slides, e.g. to comment on certain aspects, you can open a chalkboard or whiteboard on which you can make notes. The main use case in mind when implementing the plugin is classroom usage in which you may want to explain some course content and quickly need to make some notes.</description>

      <description>Chalkboard With this plugin you can add a chalkboard to reveal.js. The plugin provides two possibilities to include handwritten notes to your presentation:
you can make notes directly on the slides, e.g. to comment on certain aspects, you can open a chalkboard or whiteboard on which you can make notes. The main use case in mind when implementing the plugin is classroom usage in which you may want to explain some course content and quickly need to make some notes.</description>
