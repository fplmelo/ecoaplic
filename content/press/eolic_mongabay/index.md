abstract: Biologist Felipe Melo, a co-author of the 2019 study, describes what happened in Pernambuco in 2015 "State legislation was amended to change the altitude threshold for permanent preservation areas (APP), in a move aimed at benefiting the wind power industry. Essentially, the minimum altitude at which vegetation could be protected rose from 750 meters to 1,100 meters (about 2,500 to 3,300 feet). Anything lower than that i.e. land ideal for setting up a wind farm — would be unable to get APP protection."

summary: Brazil is among the top 10 countries in terms of installed capacity for wind power; 85% of the 10,000-plus turbines in operation are in the Caatinga biome, where winds are ideal for energy generation.
