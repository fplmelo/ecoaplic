intro: How to manage and restore social-ecological landscapes? To answer this question, I draw on the theoretical and analytical tools of natural sciences but also on the social-ecological systems (SES) framework. I am interested in all kinds of interactions between biodiversity and human activities that take place in working landscapes such as rangelands, farmlands, peri-urban and fragmented landscapes. My research products are shared between basic and applied sciences with a strong interdisciplinary integration.
