## Why this presentation?

- This is a brief summary of the grades of this cohort
- Intends to provide an overview of the 24-25 population
- Understand strengths and weakenesses
- Provide overall feedback

## Overview

```{r}
#| include: false
#| echo: true
grades_rmda <- read.csv("~/Google Drive/NTU/teaching/RMDA/grades_rmda.csv")

```

- 70 exams submitted :anguished:
- 48% Distinction + Commendation :sunglasses:
- Only 5 failed :persevere:
- 2 weeks of reading of hundreds of pages and codes :tired_face:

## Distribution of grades

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

# Add label position
grades_rmda %>% 
  mutate_all(na_if,"") %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  count(grade) %>%
  # group_by(grade) %>%          # now required with changes to dplyr::count()
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n)) -> grades_rmda 
grades_rmda %>% 
  mutate(csum = rev(cumsum(rev(n))), 
         pos = n/2 + lead(csum, 1),
         pos = if_else(is.na(pos), n/2, pos)) %>% 
mutate(grade=fct_relevel(grade,c("FLOW","FMID","PLOW","PMID","PHIGH","CLOW","CMID","CHIGH","DLOW","DMID","DHIGH","DEXC"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=grade, y= n, fill=grade)) +
  geom_col()
  #geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1, color="white") +
  #coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  #geom_text(aes(x = 1.6, label = scales::percent(prop, accuracy = .1)), position = position_stack(vjust = .5)) +
  #scale_fill_discrete(direction=-1)+
  #theme_void() # remove background, grid, numeric labels

  
```
Generally good grades, distributed towards higher marks

## What about each session?

```{r}
grades_rmda <- read.csv("~/Google Drive/NTU/teaching/RMDA/grades_rmda.csv")

grades_rmda %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols= title:norms,
               names_to = "session",
               values_to = "mark",
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  mutate_all(na_if,"") %>%
  na.omit() -> grades_per_question

grades_per_question %>% 
  mutate(mark=fct_relevel(mark,c("FLOW","FMID","FMARG", "PLOW","PMID","PHIGH","CLOW","CMID","CHIGH","DLOW","DMID","DHIGH","DEXC"))) %>% 
  group_by(session, mark) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  mutate(session=factor(session, levels = c("title","intro","meth","res","disc","norms"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(session, n, fill=mark))+
  geom_col(position = "fill")+
  #theme_bw()+theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size=20))+
  labs(x= "Session", y = "Proportion of grades")

```

Nice title pages, variation in all other aspects. attention to norms, where many failed

## Negative Highlights

- Poorly commented R scripts or Rpubs persists
- Lots of misinterpretations of figures and analyses
- Unnecessary complex analyses
- Excessive descriptive analyses in the papers rather than in the scripts

## Positive Highlights
- Good grades reflect ability of the cohort to thrive. Well done!
- Incorporation of ethics statements
- Some interesting creative approaches for figures, tables and analyses


## Things to improve in the RM&DA Module
- Next year's data will be on Pokemons (really) to expand reasoning 
- Invest on well-commented scripts rather than a whole paper

## Final comments
:::{columns}

:::{.column}
- I am very happy with the overall performance of the cohort
- This is a difficult module and we all learned from challenges
- Stats is a never-ending learning process, keep practicing
