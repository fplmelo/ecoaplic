## Brief

This module aims to provide students with the main conceptual frameworks needed to understand why, where and how conservation conflicts emerge and how to set priorities for conservation in a changing world based on the best available evidence and analytical approaches. A broad range of disciplines will be presented with focus on how they contribute to solve conservation problems.

## Engange with this module

Attendance to both face to face and online live sessions is very important, and compulsory. Although some sessions will be recorded, you might have questions, or you might benefit from one of your peer's questions. Attendance to sessions also helps to build our community, which is based on an understanding that different students learn at a different pace and they come to the module with different experiences and skills.

The NOW page has been designed to facilitate engagement with the materials, please take time to familiarise yourself with the structure.

All the online teaching will take place through Microsoft Teams. Please do take time to become familiar with the software. It is important that you have a microphone, and it would be great (although no essential) if you also have a camera, so the communication with other peers and academics is easier (and friendlier!).

We will communicate on weekly basis the details of the upcoming session, so please check the Upcoming sessions and materials section at the top of the NOW page.
